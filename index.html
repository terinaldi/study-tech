      <h2>THE BARRIERS TO STUDY</h2>
      <p>Based on article "The Barriers to Study" by L. Ron Hubbard</p>
      <p>It has been discovered that there are three definite barriers which can block a person’s ability to study and thus his ability to be educated. These barriers actually produce physical and mental reactions.</p>
      <p>If one knows and understands what these barriers are and how to handle them, his ability to study and learn will be greatly increased.</p>
      <p>The Barriers to Study form the core basis of The Technology of Study®.</p>

    <!-- Absence of Mass -->
    <div id="mass" class="page">
      <button class="back-btn" onclick="showPage('main')">← Back to Main</button>
      <h2>The First Barrier to Study: Absence of Mass</h2>
      <p>If one is attempting to understand the function and operation of a car or a computer or a solar system, the printed page and spoken word are no substitute for the object itself.</p>
      <p>It would be difficult to understand how to use a computer for the first time if you did not have the computer there in front of you. In fact, lacking the object associated with a word can inhibit all understanding (I think we can agree here that attempting to study how an aircraft flies and the various parts of an aircraft, without ever seeing or touching an aircraft, or a reasonable mock-up of one, would make a successful study of it pretty much impossible).</p>
      <p>If the mass of a subject is absent, you can actually feel squashed. It can make you feel bent, sort of spinny, sort of dead, or bored. A person studying a subject without the objects related to that subject, will experience these and several other specific reactions.</p>
      <p>Knowing how to identify and handle these reactions is vital to a student's ability to grasp and use a subject - and more than vital to a teacher's ability to get a student to learn the subject.</p>

      <button class="back-btn" onclick="showPage('main')">← Back to Main</button>
      <h2>The Second Barrier to Study: Skipped Gradient</h2>
      <p>A gradient is a way of learning or doing something step by step. A gradient can be easy where each step can be done easily, or it can be hard where each step is difficult to do.</p>
      <p>Too steep a gradient consists of not having mastered prior skills before going on to more complicated or detailed steps.</p>
      <p>A student who has skipped a gradient may feel a sort of confusion or a feeling of reeling (i.e., moving or swaying like you might fall).</p>
      <p>These are two reactions a person can experience when they have missed a step or hit too steep a gradient in the subject they’re studying.</p>
      <p>This is often referred to as “missed basic skills” or “insufficient basic skills.”</p>

      <h2>The Third Barrier to Study: Misunderstood Word</h2>
      <p>The third and most important barrier is the misunderstood word.</p>
      <p>“Mis” means not or wrongly. “Misunderstood” means not understood or wrongly understood. A misunderstood word is a word which is not understood or a word which is wrongly understood.</p>
      <p>Have you ever been reading a book or a report, gotten to the end of the page and couldn’t remember what you read? Therein lies the phenomena of the misunderstood word—all becomes distinctly blank beyond a word not understood or wrongly understood.</p>
      <p>It can make you feel blank or washed out. It can make you feel “not there” and a sort of a nervous upset feeling can follow after that.</p>
      <p>The matter is far more critical than one might surmise and of the three barriers it is the misunderstood that bears most upon human relations, the mind and understanding.</p>
      <p>It is the misunderstood word that establishes aptitude—or lack of it.</p>
      <p>It produces a vast panorama of reactions and is the prime factor involved with stupidity. It also determines whether or not one can actually perform a learned skill, and to what degree of proficiency. All of these are the result of one or more words or symbols not understood or wrongly understood.</p>
      <p>The misunderstood word can stop a student in his tracks completely. Knowing how to determine when there is a misunderstood word or symbol, how to find it and how to handle it are critical to the success of any student.</p>

      <button class="back-btn" onclick="showPage('main')">← Back to Main</button>
      <h2>Why Clear Your Words?</h2>
      <p>Basic Word Clearing is the method of finding a misunderstood word by looking earlier in the text than where you are having trouble.</p>
      <p>When studying something, it is important to know how to keep yourself moving along and doing well. To be a successful student, you should look up each word you come to that you don’t understand. Never leave a word behind you that you don’t know the meaning of.</p>
      <p>But if you ever run into trouble while studying, you would use Basic Word Clearing to help you find and handle the misunderstood word that stopped your successful study progress. Anyone helping you with your studies would use this method and you can also use it to help anyone else.</p>
      <p>As soon as you slow down or you don’t feel quite as “bright” as you did fifteen minutes ago, that is the time to use Basic Word Clearing and look for the misunderstood word.</p>
      <p>Don’t wait until you start feeling half asleep or are actually falling asleep while studying something. That is waiting far too long to find and clear the misunderstood word. You went past a word you did not fully understand long before you started to feel sleepy.</p>
      <p>If you have ever seen another person falling asleep while reading a book, then you have seen what happens well after the person went blank from passing a misunderstood word.</p>
      <p>And remember that it is not a group of words or an idea that was misunderstood; it is a misunderstood word. Going past a misunderstood word is always what happens first. It’s what happens before a whole subject is misunderstood.</p>

    <div id="how-to-clear" class="page">
      <button class="back-btn" onclick="showPage('main')">← Back to Main</button>
      <h2>How to Clear a Word</h2>
      <p>Basic Word Clearing is done as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You realize that you are not moving along on your studies as fast as you were or that you are not as bright as you were earlier. It might also be one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>You are just not as interested in what you are studying.</li>
            <li>You are taking too long to get through something.</li>
            <li>You might be yawning.</li>
            <li>You might be doodling (scribbling or making patterns or designs with a pen or pencil).</li>
            <li>You might be daydreaming, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As soon as this happens, you must stop and look earlier in what you were studying and find the misunderstood word. There will always be one there and you must find it. There are no exceptions. It may be that the misunderstood word is two pages or more before the place where you stopped studying. But it is always earlier in the text than where you are now.</li>
        <li>You find the word. You may recognize it while looking back for it, but if you can’t find it, you or the person helping you with your study can pick out words from what you were reading that could be the misunderstood word. Someone helping you can ask, “What does ______ mean?” to see if you give the correct definition.</li>
        <li>When you have found the misunderstood word, you look it up in a dictionary and clear it per the Steps to Clear a Word section of this course. You look up and clear the definition that fits the context. You use it in sentences that you make up, until you fully understand it. Then you clear each of the listed definitions and use each of them several times in sentences until you fully understand the word. You then clear the derivation and any idioms or synonyms, etc.</li>
        <li>Now that you have a full understanding of the word, you go back to what you were reading and once again read the part that contained the misunderstood word. If you are still not “bright,” wanting to get on with it and feeling happier about it, then there is another misunderstood word earlier in the text. You must find it and clear it by repeating steps 2 to 5 above.</li>
        <li>When you feel bright and enthusiastic again, that is the end result of Basic Word Clearing. (The result won’t be achieved if a word you did not understand was missed or if there is an earlier misunderstood word in the text. If this happens, repeat steps 2 to 5.) If you are now enthusiastic, continue studying the text from where the misunderstood was found and cleared.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>In summary, the steps of Basic Word Clearing are as follows:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a. Find out where you weren’t having any trouble.</li>
        <li>b. Find out where you are now having trouble.</li>
        <li>c. The misunderstood word will be right at the end of where you weren’t having trouble. It will be right in that immediate area. You can pinpoint it.</li>

        <li>Each time he leaves out or changes a word or hesitates or frowns as he reads a word, take it up at once.</li>
        <li>Correct it by looking up the word he left out or changed or hesitated or frowned while reading. Find the definition for him in a dictionary or explain it to him.</li>
        <li>When you have cleared up the meaning of the word, get the student to go back to the book or material and carry on reading and note the next time he leaves out or changes a word or hesitates or frowns.</li>
